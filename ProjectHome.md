This is a public release of the SAP PI (Process Integration) tools that [Figaf](http://www.figaf.com) has released. It is possible to try both tools on [Figaf](http://www.figaf.com), but this release should make it easier for to tweak the layouts to fit your preferences or not sending the stylesheets to the Figaf servers.

For more information about the tool see my SDN [blog](https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/weblogs?blog=/pub/wlg/14129).

The project contains two tools.

  * One for creating Excel documenations of mappings

  * One for comparing two pi mappings and finding the differences.

To get started to go the [Installation](Installation.md) page and see how to install the system.

To find the how to use the tools see [Usage](Usage.md).
