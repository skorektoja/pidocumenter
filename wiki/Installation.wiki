How to install the pidocument tool on you computer


= Steps =

  # Download and install PHP from http://www.php.net/downloads.php
  # Download the pidocumenter release from the download page
  # Extract the pidocumenter zip file to a directory
  # Download PHPExcel from [http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=10715 codeplex]. Notice there is currently a problem with formatting on diff tool with release 1.6.7 so please use 1.6.6 instead. 
  # Extract the PHPExcel. Copy the files from the zip files folder classes to the lib in the pidocument folder. It is the file PHPExcel.php and the folder (with subfolders) PHPExcel.
  # You are now able to run the scripts. 
  # The build in unzip tool does not work in some instance. I have therefore used the unzip from http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/. Download the zip file, extract the file and update your path to include `<extractfolder>` \usr\local\wbin
